It's been happening in humans for *all* of recorded history. It has been observed in dogs, cats and other mammals. It's natural for a 'homosexual' view of beauty to come through in even straight men and women. We're nowhere near as simple as we like to think we are.\n\nAs for your \"the male form is more aesthetically pleasing\", I disagree as I believe we are programmed by our genetics to appreciate curves. In nature, in mathematics, in bodily form, in lingusitic expression. BUT the ideal male form is more detailed - simply put, sculpting an ideal male form that is aesthetically pleasing is more difficult.\n\nAlso, \"aesthetically pleasing\" is a complicated thing in itself. The male aesthetic ideal is (generally) considered to be in the peak of athletic condition striking a pose that demonstrates his perfection as a fluid machine, wound like a spring but perfectly controlled. It's difficult to encapsulate all this.

While I certainly applaud anyone wanting to do a hundred pushups, take it from this old gym rat, I've spent my entire adult life in the gym, and a program like this one can do more harm than good.\n\nIf you only train one part of your body (and that's all a single exercise like pushups is going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for injuries down the road. I've seen it a hundred times.\n\nIt's like putting a powerful engine in a stock Toyota Tercel. What will you accomplish? You'll blow out the drive train, the clutch, the transmission, etc., because those factory parts aren't designed to handle the power of an engine much more powerful than the factory installed engine.\n\nPushups basically only train the chest muscles and to some extent, the triceps. What you really want to do is train your entire body, all the major muscle groups (chest, back, abdomen, legs, shoulders and arms) at the same time, over the course of a workout. And don't forget your cardiovascular work!\n\nI'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three cheers! Falling in love with exercise, eating right, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make.\n\nBut do it right, okay?\n\nMy advice, find a good gym, with qualified trainers who will design your programs for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for physical fitness. Thirty to 45 minutes a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is).\n\nAnd don't worry about being embarrassed or not being in shape the first time you walk into the gym. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway.\n\nNow get out there and do it! :-)","link_id":"t3_9fylh","ups":2,"author_flair_text":null,"controversiality":0,"distinguished":null,"edited":true}

We are all the product of our environment. Mind you my evidence is entirely anecdotal... but it's been a bit of a curious point for me in recent years as I've noticed that... well, everyone really has wildly different ideas of who is attractive/who is not, etc. So I've discussed with a number of people I know, and the one thing that seems pretty common among everyone I've spoken with is this: We tend to find the sorts of people we grew up around attractive. To wit, I'm Caucasian but grew up in a city with a heavy mix of various Asian cultures, as well as a large Mexican community. There are many, many other communities there mind you, but most everyone from the area (especially the part of town I grew up in) will tell you that as the ethnic breakdown goes, Mexicans and Vietnamese dominate. As most of the girls I grew up alongside/went to school with were generally either of the two afore-mentioned elasticities, I tend to be most attracted to Mexican girls and Southeast Asian girls. White girls rarely do anything for me.\n\nBy contrast another friend of mine grew up down here in LA, in a community that was predominantly Black, though around high-school his family moved to an extremely White city. He's most attracted to Black girls and White girls.\n\nBut in both our cases it's not a hard-and-fast rule either.

The whole Bowl of Winds plot was a huge waste of time, excluding Mat of course, Perrin's plot is a waste of time, and so is Elyane's. I would recommend reading the chapters with the characters you like and reading plot summaries for the boring ones. Loial gets sent on a mission and disappears for a while, and Jordan probably should have done this with the other characters too.

I'm not saying it's not theft. But it's also not a loss to them UNLESS the person downloading would have bought the movie if they couldn't have downloaded it.\n\nAs I pointed out previously, he already helped support the movie by buying a ticket. Chances are since he liked it so much he's going to spread some positive reviews about the movie (online, word of mouth whatever) which stand a chance of driving even more people to go see the movie. Some of them might even decide to buy the movie when it comes out.\n\nAnd i think a lot of people who go to the movies, go because they want to go see it in a theater on a big screen. So while maybe some people would do as you suggest, i think most would not. Besides, how many people are going to want to go through the hassle of going to a theater either to just get the movie or to sit and watch it and then have to watch it again with their friends?\n\nThe movie and music industry tends to lose out by screwing thermselves. They want to maintain an iron fist control over everything when that is impossible. Instead of going with the flow and giving people what they want when they want it, they still want to try and stick to an outdated distribution system. So they suffer the consequences when people live in an age where you can have just about any content as soon as it's created. \n\nAgain i'm not really auguring morality here.

All your files will work on SuSE.\n   * No DRM. The system is designed to do what you want, not what the media industry wants.\n   * No deliberate obfuscation! Your MP3 player software doesn't try to hide your MP3s from you to make it harder to move away, like iTunes does.\n   * There are customized distros for particular purposes, like the [Eeebuntu](http://www.eeebuntu.org/) I use on my Asus EeePC netbook.\n   * End-users never, ever have to worry about licenses or piracy.\n   * Open software development means nobody can get away with sneaking anti-features like spyware into the next release of their stuff.\n   * If your system gets hozed, you can reinstall without calling tech support to get a new license key.\n\nThere are plenty of other benefits too. Just a few of them ...\n\n   * Package repositories and apt/yum/etc. Most applications software is distributed via the same channel as the OS itself. Even though it's not written by the same folks, it's tested for compatibility.\n   * Security. No, it's not perfectly secure. Yes, there's such a thing as malware for Linux. Yes, some of the security is due to being a minority system. But you will spend *much less* time and effort dealing with malicious software on Linux than on Windows.\n   * Customization. Can't read the default fonts? Change 'em. There's no Steve Jobs telling you not to monkey with his sacred User Experience.\n   * Scaling up. Linux can use your quad processor machine efficiently.\n   * Scaling down.

Also, if you think it requires \"faith\" to see that 1 + 1 = 2, then you're obviously giving the term too much power.\n\n&gt; Claiming that \"Science and Logic\" are the only all encompassing truth is a religious belief.\n\nScience and logic aren't truths.

So far, I haven't heard any that even came close to topping it.\n\nI was taking a special University program for kids who excelled in the sciences at the University of South Florida-Tampa. We were taking a Biology lab, standing around in our lab coats and peering through our microscopes. One of the girls there, Meghan, did very well in the program - so well, in fact, that she got A's on everything. In this class, though, she must have got a stray B somewhere, because she was whining loudly to everyone within earshot that her smattering of B's might endanger her chance to score another A. It was irritating but all of us ignored it, going about our work in silence. Then, out of nowhere, we heard a loud voice boom out; we turned around and saw another student, David, leaning back with his arms spread out, saying:\n\nOH MY GOD, NOW I'LL **NEVER** GET INTO HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL!!!\n\nIt was, without question, the sharpest, funniest, and most devastating comeback I've ever heard anyone deliver. What made it so great was that it was fearless - he belted it out like he was on Broadway, so loudly he could never back out if it fell flat. We could've stared at him awkwardly or let his joke just die there. Worse, there was a lab proctor in the room, and he could've come down hard on him for that. But instead, we all froze and listened, and it brought down the house. EVERYONE stopped what they were doing and doubled over laughing. Then Meghan started bitching about how that wasn't what she meant, c'mon guys, etc., etc., which made an already terrific joke almost painfully hilarious. They say timing is everything, and his timing was so right - everything we found annoying about Meghan, in one truthy line - that we couldn't stop laughing until she left the room. I laughed until there were tears in my eyes, as did all the people around me. \n\nAnd, David, if you're reading this, let me tell you: I don't remember hardly any of the material I studied that summer, but I'll remember that joke until the day that I die.\n\n\n","link_id":"t3_9g0fe","ups":152,"created_utc":"1251763837","retrieved_on":1426033658,"archived":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"id":"c0cmv17"}

Obviously this statement won't hold much weight, but this is why Scientologists believe our religion is based of off science.\n\nBut this is only part of science. Science is not a \"one shot\" deal. It does not begin and and with a single researcher.  It is an ongoing process of continuous improvement and advancement. SCientology, by contrast, is pretty much done in terms of how far it will advance. L. Ron Hubbard is dead. And Scientologists are not allowed to alter the Tech. This is not how science works. \n\nCan you imagine a physicist who studied physics for decades and never once came up with anything new or disproved old theories? He'd be deemed a failure.  \n\nScientology is based on science in name only. \n\n&gt; In order to become an auditor, one studies the e-meter very thoroughly and learns exactly what it is measuring and how it does so.\n\nYou may be surpised to know that the e-meter was actually in use by psychologists and psychoanalysts long before L. Ron Hubbard was even born. And it was abandoned as being too crude to to be of much use. While it is true that you can detect emotional reactions using the device, there is little else that can be accurately determined beyond that. Whatever you think it is detecting is more certainly just a rough estimation of what is actually going on. \n\nThe way the e-meter is used by Scientology is particularly problematic bacause they have the user grip the electrodes. So you're not only measuring GSR, but also minute fluctuation in the subject's grip. It is kind of like using a high powered telescope by holding it with your hands (no base).\n \n\n","link_id":"t3_9foqn","archived":true,"created_utc":"1251764150","retrieved_on":1426033660}

They have made quite a few blunders, and for some reason, Labour hasn't been able to capitalise on those. For what it's worth though, I voted for Key and I think the 90-day trial period for employees is a good idea.  \n\nPeople are all up in arms about it, because at first blush it sounds like it's hurting those it's designed to help. Say you're a solo mum who's been out of the workforce for a long time. Or someone who has spent some time in prison, but looking to get on the right path. Or a teenager looking for his first job. An employer is going to be wary about hiring you, because NZ laws make it very difficult to fire people. So naturally, they're going to opt for a \"safer\" option and be cautious about taking on these \"risky\" employees. The option of letting these people go later down the line allows employers to take these people on, at a lower risk. If the employee turns out to be a good worker, then they'll likely be offered a longer contract at the end of 90 days. Even if they aren't offered further work, they come away with three months worth of experience and a reference they otherwise wouldn't have had, given their background. The trial period acts as a way of \"filtering\" out the good workers from the not-so-good in the absense of relevant work experience or other clues as to the worker's competence.  \n\nThe same reasoning can be used to back a slightly lower wage for youth. If you're a greater risk to hire, then an employer will not hire you unless he is paying you less.

I wonder what items were from your design. I work in China and we manufacture promotional gift items (especially if made by plastic) and child car seats for exports.\n\nIn response to the OP, you are correct, there are costs that are just more cost-effective (and future loss prevention) if done in the US/elsewhere. Especially when it comes to meeting certain standards such as UL, CS, but most of all, usability and consumer friendly. Chinese design are just a tad non-detailed enough or don't consider enough to be a major difference from Western design. And not to mention the local mantra, \"no need for perfection; just needs to be working.\"\n\nBut on the other side of the coin, there are so many items I see, that I don't think USA would want to make. Styrofoam cups, straws, forks, china plates, low value low design everyday consumer items, and these are plentiful. There should be a better allocation of resources away from these items and into high value items given the living standards / costs in the US. So as a response to the OP, there is really no need to worry about China's stronghold ON THESE manufactured items.\n\nmailinator1138 though, you are correct in your creator / parasite comment. In China nowadays, because of the bad 1st quarter, most manufacturing won't make a good profit compared to 2007 when the whole year was in a party-mood. This year, because of the rally in the stock market, people have been using what finances they have and put into the stocks, getting much better returns on money so far. (note I didn't use capital because, quite frankly, most of the money used are probably loans / credits instead of real capital.)\n\nAnd this is exactly your parasite description. And this is a path I'm afraid China will follow the US. \n\nInstead of keep on innovating and creating values through design and inventions, more and more capital and focus and energies are put into finance. \n\nFinance uses excess capital from old-school value creation (profit), but people treat further finance as value creation. I see it more as bubble creation, as additional value in finance is created by leveraging. But when new capital is provided due to profits from value creation, that is really an expansion of wealth. \n\nAnyway, it is much easier to \"do\" than \"think and create\", but hopefully for all countries' sake, the market force / attraction of profit / moral urgency is still powerful enough a lure for people to get out of the DO mode and into the CREATING mode.

One study in Chicago found that a foreclosed home reduces the price of nearby homes by as much as 9 percent.\"\n\nWait, but what if I'm one of the responsible home buyers who put down a large down payment, bought within their means, and didn't overextend themselves financially?\n\n&gt;\"Even if your neighborhood hasn't been hit by foreclosures, you're likely feeling the effects of the crisis in other ways. Companies in your community that depend on the housing market - construction companies and home furnishing stores, painters and landscapers - they're cutting back and laying people off.\"\n\nWe're not running out of places for people to live. These industries are wasteful, consume tons of resources, or are simply unnecessary for the middle class (see:landscaping).\n\n&gt;\"The effects of this crisis have also reverberated across the financial markets. When the housing market collapsed, so did the availability of credit on which our economy depends...In the end, all of us are paying a price for this home mortgage crisis. And all of us will pay an even steeper price if we allow this crisis to deepen - a crisis which is unraveling homeownership, the middle class, and the American Dream itself.\"\n\nSo, we need to re-inflate the bubble? The middle class, American lifestyle **is** unsustainable. The suburbs are a disaster from an environmental and transit perspective -- home prices have not kept up with incomes, and people are spending larger and larger amounts of their paychecks on mortgage payments...could that be a cause of the shrinking middle class?\n\n&gt;\"And we are not just helping homeowners at risk of falling over the edge, we are preventing their neighbors from being pulled over that edge too - as defaults and foreclosures contribute to sinking home values, failing local businesses, and lost jobs.\"\n\nMore scare tactics...nicely done. If you didn't plan your financial life for a few bumps and weren't responsible with your money (renting or buying within your means) I have little sympathy for you. Blaming the lender (see:salesman) is a cop-out on your responsibility as an adult to manage your finances and understanding contractual obligations. \n\n&gt;\"And by bringing down the foreclosure rate, it will help to shore up housing prices for everyone. \"\n\nWait, **what the fuck!?!?!?!?** Homes *are* overpriced, \"Shore up\" is code for re-inflate -- Obama has stated that putting off the inevitable will only lead to further disaster in the future, but I guess this is one exception for him...\n\n&gt;\"Our housing crisis was born of eroding home values, but also of the erosion of our common values.\"\n\nMy grandfather supported five children, his wife, and made mortgage payments all on blue-collar, relatively low-wage factory job, and someone working that same job today could hardly afford to find a descent apartment in the same area. The middle class has been shrinking because wages have not kept up with the cost of goods and living.   \n\n&gt;\"then I am confident we will overcome this crisis and once again secure that dream for ourselves and for generations to come.\"\n\nAmericans working harder, longer hours with less benefits than their parents...taking an average of [13 days of vacation, lowest in the industrialized world](http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/baldoni/2009/08/why_you_need_a_vacation.html)...all so corporations can get rich selling us shit from China and other exploitable foreign markets.
